/// Tab-precision jump-back: land on the exact terminal tab or split pane the

/// WezTerm to its own CLI, tmux to `list-panes` — matching the two is the whole
/// trick. Everything here is best effort on a background queue: any miss (no tty,
/// scripting denied, app too old) leaves the plain app-level focus that always

/// What each host can be asked for, and how much of it is proven:
///
/// - **iTerm2, Terminal.app, WezTerm** — the tab by tty, reported as a hit or a
///   miss. These are the only hosts a keystroke may be aimed at directly.
/// - **tmux**, in any of those three — the pane by tty, then the outer tab by the
///   tmux client's tty (`TmuxFocus`). Aimable only when both halves report a hit.
/// - **kitty** — `kitty @ focus-window`, which works only for a user who set
///   `listen_on` and allowed remote control, and says nothing we could check the
///   landing against. Focus, never a target.
/// - **Ghostty** — its AppleScript dictionary (1.3) lists terminals by working
///   directory and can focus one, but exposes neither tty nor pid. The only honest
///   match is "the one terminal in this directory"; two in the same directory and
///   it stays at app level. Focus, never a target.
/// - **Editors** (VS Code, Cursor, Zed, …) — the app found by process ancestry,
///   then its window for the session's folder. Focus, never a target.
/// - **Anything else** — the app found by process ancestry, which is still the
///   right app even when TERM_PROGRAM names none.
